    postLit fire is a feature that was introduced to postLit on
    December 25th, 2022. It allows people who have the badge to 
    upload images to their posts and upload custom banners that 
    show up on your profile! It currently can be obtained by 
    clicking on a postLit fire link that will give you the badge.
